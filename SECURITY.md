## [Bug Bounty Program](https://github.com/xeon-protocol/xeon-dapp/blob/main/bug-bounty.md) &middot; ![eligible](https://img.shields.io/badge/v1--core-eligible-darkgreen.svg) ![not eligible](https://img.shields.io/badge/xeon--dapp-not_eligible-red.svg)

Portions of our codebase are subject to the Xeon Protocol Bug Bounty (the "Program") to incentivize responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities. We are offering XEON token rewards for submissions that meet eligibility criteria.

### Community Audit Program

In order to maximize the security of our `v1-core` contracts, we will be opening them for community audit prior to their release on mainnet. If you are a Solidity developer with auditing experience, and would like to earn XEON token rewards in exchange for providing a detailed contract audit, please contact us on [Telegram](https://t.me/XeonProtocolPortal), or by [email](mailto:jon@xeon-protocol.io) for an invite to an audit discussion in Slack.
